# csv-enricher-hero

Functionality and Process:

	1.	CSV Upload and Parsing:
	â€¢	Users select and upload a CSV file.
	â€¢	The app parses the CSV file and stores the data in a state.
	â€¢	Once parsed, the data is displayed in a table format.
	2.	Data Display with Pagination:
	â€¢	The table displaying the CSV data should paginate to handle large datasets.
	â€¢	The pagination should be user-friendly, with clear navigation to move between pages.
	â€¢	Each page should display a fixed number of rows (e.g., 10 or 20) to ensure performance is maintained.
	3.	Initiate Enrichment Process:
	â€¢	Users click a button to start the enrichment process.
	â€¢	The app sends each row to the Anthropic Claude API.
	â€¢	The API returns a description for each row, which is then displayed in the table.
	â€¢	The app should show real-time progress of the enrichment process, perhaps with a progress bar or percentage completion indicator.
	4.	Visual and Functional Feedback:
	â€¢	The UI should provide clear feedback at each step: uploading, parsing, displaying, and enriching.
	â€¢	Use visual indicators such as progress bars, loading spinners, or success/error messages to keep the user informed.

Design Considerations:

	â€¢	The app should use Shad/cdn components for a consistent and modern look.
	â€¢	The interface should be clean, simple, and responsive to ensure a good user experience on various devices.
	â€¢	Focus on usability, ensuring that all interactions are straightforward and intuitive.

Final Notes:

	â€¢	Security is not a primary concern for this internal tool, so API keys can be hardcoded.
	â€¢	Aim for a balance between functionality and simplicity, ensuring the tool is easy to use while meeting the core requirements.
